<h2>Life</h2>
<p>David Jon Gilmour was born on 6 March 1946 in Cambridge, England.[6] His father, Douglas Gilmour, was a senior lecturer in zoology at the University of Cambridge, and his mother, Sylvia (n√©e Wilson), trained as a teacher and later worked as a film editor for the BBC.[7] At the time of Gilmour's birth, they lived in Trumpington, Cambridgeshire. In 1956, after several relocations, they moved to nearby Grantchester Meadows.[8][n 1]

    Gilmour's parents encouraged him to pursue his interest in music, and in 1954 he bought his first single, Bill Haley's "Rock Around the Clock".[10] His enthusiasm was stirred the following year by Elvis Presley's "Heartbreak Hotel", and later "Bye Bye Love" by the Everly Brothers piqued his interest in the guitar. He borrowed a guitar from a neighbour, but never gave it back. Soon afterward, Gilmour started teaching himself to play using a book and record set by Pete Seeger.[11] At age 11, Gilmour began attending Perse School on Hills Road, Cambridge, which he did not enjoy.[12] There he met the future Pink Floyd members Syd Barrett and Roger Waters, who attended Cambridgeshire High School for Boys, also situated on Hills Road.[13]
    
    In 1962, Gilmour began studying A-Level modern languages at the Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology.[12] Despite not finishing the course, he eventually learned to speak fluent French.[12] Barrett was also a student at the college, and he spent his lunchtimes practising guitar with Gilmour.[12] In late 1962, Gilmour joined the blues rock band Jokers Wild. The band recorded a one-sided album and a single at Regent Sound Studio, in Denmark Street, west London, but only 50 copies of each were made.[12]
    
    In August 1965, Gilmour busked around Spain and France with Barrett and some other friends.[citation needed] He and Barrett later went to Paris, where they camped outside the city for a week and visited the Louvre.[14] During this time, Gilmour worked in various places, most notably as the driver and assistant for the fashion designer Ossie Clark.[15]
    
    Gilmour travelled to France in mid-1967 with Rick Wills and Willie Wilson, formerly of Jokers Wild. The trio performed under the name Flowers, then Bullitt, but were not commercially successful. After hearing their covers of chart hits, club owners were reluctant to pay them, and soon after their arrival in Paris, thieves stole their equipment.[16] In France, Gilmour contributed lead vocals to two songs on the soundtrack of the film Two Weeks in September, starring Brigitte Bardot.[7] When Bullitt returned to England later that year, they were so impoverished that their tour bus was completely empty of petrol and they had to push it off the ferry onto the landing</p>
